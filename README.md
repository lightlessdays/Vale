## frontend
The frontend of this app has been designed using Flutter framework created by Google. Before putting to code, I used Figma to create the UI. [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/fq20K5oit1tj1NIdoQd738/Vale?node-id=0%3A1) is the link to the initial UI created in Fimga.

The archtitechture used is MVC archtitechture. All the graphics have been created using Adobe Photoshop (including mockups of hats). To store images in user's device as cache, an external library [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) has been used.
