## frontend

The frontend of this app has been designed using Flutter framework created by Google. Before putting to code, I used Figma to create the UI. [Here](https://www.figma.com/file/fq20K5oit1tj1NIdoQd738/Vale?node-id=0%3A1) is the link to the initial UI created in Figma.

The archtitechture used is MVC archtitechture. All the graphics have been created using Adobe Photoshop (including mockups of hats). To store images in user's device as cache, an external library [cached_network_image](https://pub.dev/packages/cached_network_image) has been used. 

## backend

This app has been written using Dart. Each users' data and orders are stored in a NoSQL database (Cloud Firestore). CRUD operations require the user to connect to the internet. Payment Gateways have been built using Razorpay (these are mock payment gateways, so do no make any payment using those gateways). Also, Google Maps API has been integrated in the app in the Store Locator section.
